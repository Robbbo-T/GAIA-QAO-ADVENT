## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Aircraft Description

The AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 is a conceptual, 100-passenger regional aircraft with a Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration, designed for aerodynamic efficiency, reduced fuel consumption, and enhanced passenger comfort. The BWB design eliminates the clear distinction between wings and fuselage, allowing the entire airframe to generate lift, which reduces drag and fuel burn by up to 50% compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Passenger Capacity:** ~100 passengers (regional jet configuration)
- **Configuration:** BWB with no distinct fuselage, smoothly blended wings, and potentially tailless design
- **Propulsion:** Turbofan engines with quantum-enhanced fan modules (GQ-AIR-TURB-FAN-01)
- **Range:** Likely 2,000â€“3,000 nautical miles, typical for regional jets with BWB efficiency
- **Quantum Integration:** Real-time structural health monitoring and operational optimization

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

The aircraft integrates quantum technologies (e.g., quantum strain sensors, telemetry) to enable real-time structural health monitoring and operational optimization, aligning with the Q-AIR domain's focus on quantum-augmented aerospace systems.
