## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines procedures for transit servicing of the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100, where the aircraft makes intermediate stops with minimal ground time while maintaining operational readiness and quantum system integrity.

### 1.2 Scope
Covers all ground operations during transit stops, typically 20-45 minutes, where the aircraft remains in an active state with engines running or on APU power.

### 1.3 Key Principles
- **Continuous Readiness**: Aircraft remains in near-flight configuration
- **Quantum Continuity**: Maintain quantum system coherence
- **Efficiency**: Minimize ground time without compromising safety
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to various transit scenarios
- **Sustainability**: Optimize resource usage during brief stops

---

## 2. Transit Service Overview
