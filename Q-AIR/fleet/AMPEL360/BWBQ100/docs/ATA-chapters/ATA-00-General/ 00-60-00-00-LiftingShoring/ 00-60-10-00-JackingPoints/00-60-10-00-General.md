## 1. General Information

### 1.1 Scope and Purpose

This document provides comprehensive general information, inspection criteria, and safety precautions applicable to ALL jacking points on the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft. It serves as a mandatory prerequisite for any specific jacking point procedure found in ATA Chapter `00-60-10-XX`.

**Key Functions:**
- Establish standardized procedures for jacking point preparation and inspection
- Define quantum structural monitoring integration requirements
- Specify safety protocols for BWB-specific structural considerations
- Provide quality assurance framework for jacking operations

**Critical Note:** This manual describes the common requirements for preparing and using the structurally reinforced hard points designed to interface with ground support jacks, but does not encompass the complete aircraft lifting procedure.

### 1.2 Relation to Overview Document

## 2. Jacking Point Philosophy (BWB)

### 2.1 Structural Cage Concept

Unlike conventional aircraft where jacking points are typically reinforced skin panels, the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 jacking points represent sophisticated **"structural cages"** - integrated sub-assemblies where multiple load-bearing members converge.

**Structural Cage Components:**
- **Primary Spars:** Main longitudinal load-bearing elements
- **Reinforced Ribs:** Lateral load distribution structures  
- **Integrated Frames:** Cross-sectional structural support
- **Load Distribution Plates:** Specialized interface elements
- **QSM Sensor Clusters:** Quantum monitoring integration points

**Design Philosophy:**
```yaml
BWB_Jacking_Point_Design:
  Primary_Objective: "Distribute lifting forces into primary structure"
  Load_Path_Strategy: "Multi-point distribution prevents localization"
  Monitoring_Integration: "Real-time quantum stress analysis"
  Safety_Margin: "150% of maximum design load"
  Fail_Safe_Design: "Graceful degradation with warning"
```

### 2.2 Load Distribution Network

The jacking points function as an integrated network rather than independent lifting locations. This network approach is essential for the BWB configuration where structural loads must be carefully balanced across the wide, integrated airframe.

**Network Characteristics:**
- **Interdependent Loading:** Each point affects stress distribution at all other points
- **Dynamic Load Transfer:** Real-time adjustment based on QSM feedback
- **Redundant Load Paths:** Multiple structural members share lifting forces
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Quantum sensors provide instant feedback on structural health

**Primary Network Configurations:**
1. **Full Aircraft Lift:** All primary points (NJP-1, MJP-L, MJP-R, AJP-1) active
2. **Nose-High Configuration:** Forward points elevated for maintenance access
3. **Landing Gear Removal:** Specific combinations for gear bay access
4. **Emergency Support:** Backup configurations for failure scenarios

### 2.3 Quantum-Enhanced Load Management

The integration of Quantum Structural Monitoring (QSM) with the jacking point network represents a revolutionary advance in aircraft lifting safety and precision.

**QSM Integration Benefits:**
- **Real-Time Stress Mapping:** Continuous monitoring of structural loads
- **Predictive Failure Analysis:** Early warning of potential structural issues
- **Automated Load Balancing:** Dynamic adjustment of lifting forces
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Continuous improvement of lifting procedures

## 8. Load Distribution and Stress Analysis

### 8.1 BWB Load Path Characteristics
The structural cages of the jacking points are designed to channel forces into the BWB's primary load-bearing members. The primary path is from the jack point, through the reinforced ribs, and into the main and aft spars, which then distribute the load across the entire wing-body structure. QSM is essential for confirming these paths are engaged correctly.

### 8.2 Real-Time Stress Mapping (QSM)
The QIT "Maintenance Lift Mode" application provides a real-time 3D model of the aircraft structure, color-coded to represent stress levels.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph QIT Display
        A[3D Aircraft Model] -- Stress Data --> B{Color-Coded Stress Map};
        B -- "Green: <50%" --> C[Normal Load];
        B -- "Yellow: 50-80%" --> D[Caution];
        B -- "Red: >80%" --> E[Warning/Halt];
    end
    F[QSM Sensor Network] --> A;
```
This visual map allows the QSM operator to instantly identify areas of high stress and pre-emptively address potential issues before they exceed safety limits.

### 8.3 Torsional Load Prevention
A primary risk in lifting a BWB is inducing torsional (twisting) loads. This is prevented through two main mechanisms:
1.  **Synchronized Jacking:** The Central Jack Controller (CJC) ensures all jacks move in perfect unison, with a maximum allowable height deviation of ¬±1 mm between the main jacks (MJP-L/R).
2.  **QSM Torsion Monitoring:** The QSM network includes sensor pairs that specifically measure torsional strain across the airframe. If torsion exceeds a predefined limit, the QSM will trigger an automatic halt.

## 9. Emergency Procedures for Jacking Points

### 9.1 Jacking Point Failure Modes
Personnel must be trained to recognize the following potential failure modes specific to jacking points:
- **Adapter Slip:** The jack adapter loses its secure seating in the jacking point receptacle.
- **Structural Yielding:** The structure around the jacking point shows signs of permanent deformation (a QSM red-line event).
- **QSM Sensor Failure:** The dedicated sensor cluster for a point provides erroneous data or fails completely.
- **Hydraulic Failure at Jack:** A specific jack loses pressure or fails mechanically.
- **Fastener Failure:** Fasteners in the "structural cage" show signs of shearing or popping.

### 9.2 Emergency Response Protocol

```

### 9.3 QSM-Initiated Emergency Halts
If the QSM system detects a parameter exceeding the red-line limit at any jacking point, it will automatically execute a controlled emergency halt.
- The CJC will instantly lock all jack hydraulics.
- An audible alarm will sound in the hangar.
- The QIT will display the specific point and parameter that caused the halt (e.g., "MJP-L: Z-AXIS STRESS LIMIT EXCEEDED").
- The procedure then follows from Step 5 of the protocol in Section 9.2.

## 10. Quality Assurance and Documentation

### 10.1 QA Checkpoints
Quality assurance verification is mandatory at the following stages of any operation involving the jacking points:
1.  **Pre-Operation:** Verification of all inspection checklists (Section 4), equipment certifications, and personnel qualifications.
2.  **Adapter Installation:** A dedicated QA sign-off is required confirming correct seating and QSM link for each adapter.
3.  **Initial Load Application:** At 10% of the target load, a QA hold point is initiated to verify all QSM readings are nominal and correspond to predictions.
4.  **Post-Operation:** After lowering, a final inspection of all used jacking points must be performed and documented to check for any signs of stress or damage.

### 10.2 Digital Record Keeping
Every jacking operation creates a detailed, immutable digital record linked to the aircraft's DIKE.

### 10.3 Traceability and Audit Trail
The use of unique identifiers (GQOIS, INFOCODE, DIKE) for all documentation, equipment, and personnel ensures a complete, auditable trail for every operation. This data is used for fleet-wide health monitoring, predictive maintenance scheduling, and continuous procedure improvement.
