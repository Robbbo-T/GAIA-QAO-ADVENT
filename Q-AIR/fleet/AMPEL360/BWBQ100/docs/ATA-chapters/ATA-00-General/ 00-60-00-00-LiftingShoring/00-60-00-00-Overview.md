## 1. General Information

### 1.1 Scope and Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the standard practices, safety precautions, and equipment required for lifting, jacking, and shoring the entire AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft. It serves as the primary reference and entry point for all related maintenance procedures found within ATA Chapter 00-60.

The procedures herein are critical for maintenance tasks requiring:
- Landing gear retraction/removal
- Major structural inspections and repairs
- Engine maintenance requiring aircraft lifting
- Long-term storage preparation
- Emergency recovery operations

**Key Innovation:** The AMPEL360 represents the first commercial aircraft to integrate Quantum Structural Monitoring (QSM) with lifting operations, providing unprecedented real-time safety oversight and structural integrity verification.

### 1.2 BWB-Specific Considerations

The Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration of the AMPEL360 presents unique structural challenges and requirements compared to conventional tube-and-wing aircraft. All personnel must be thoroughly trained on the following critical aspects:

**Structural Characteristics:**
- **Distributed Load Paths:** The aircraft's weight is distributed across a wide, integrated structure rather than being concentrated in a central fuselage keel beam. Improper lifting can induce critical stresses in unintended areas
- **Aerodynamic Profile Integrity:** The precise curvature and profile of the blended wing are critical for flight performance. Lifting and shoring equipment must not deform the skin or underlying structure
- **Wider Jacking Footprint:** The main jacking points are located significantly further apart than on conventional aircraft, requiring precise synchronization and a large, level hangar space
- **Multiple Load Transfer Points:** Unlike conventional aircraft with primary wing attachment points, the BWB distributes loads through multiple interconnected structural elements

**Operational Requirements:**
- **Mandatory QSM Integration:** The Quantum Structural Monitoring (QSM) system is not optional. It must be active during all lifting, lowering, and shoring operations to provide real-time structural stress feedback and prevent damage
- **Environmental Controls:** BWB lifting operations require controlled atmospheric conditions due to the large surface area and potential for wind-induced loads
- **Precision Synchronization:** All lifting points must move in perfect coordination to prevent torsional loads on the wing structure

## 2. Critical Safety Precautions

### 2.1 MANDATORY SAFETY WARNINGS

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE PROCEDURES CAN RESULT IN SEVERE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT, SERIOUS INJURY, OR DEATH.**

**🚨 BWB-SPECIFIC WARNING: The distributed load structure of the BWB configuration means that improper lifting can cause catastrophic failure with minimal warning. ALL safety systems must be operational before commencing any lifting operation.**

### 2.2 General Safety Requirements

**Personnel Safety:**
- [ ] Ensure all non-essential personnel are cleared from the operational area (minimum 15-meter safety zone)
- [ ] Establish clear communication links between all members of the lifting team and the QSM operator
- [ ] Verify all personnel have current AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 lifting certification
- [ ] Conduct pre-operation safety briefing with all team members
- [ ] Establish emergency evacuation procedures and assembly points

**Environmental Safety:**
- [ ] Perform all operations inside a certified hangar, protected from wind and adverse weather
- [ ] Wind speeds must be less than 5 knots (2.6 m/s) during operations
- [ ] Ensure the hangar floor is level (±2mm over lifting area) and rated for combined weight of aircraft and GSE
- [ ] Verify adequate overhead clearance (minimum 2 meters above highest lifting position)
- [ ] Confirm hangar door sealing to prevent wind gusts

**Equipment Safety:**
- [ ] All lifting equipment must have valid certification and current inspection records
- [ ] Backup power systems must be available for all critical lifting equipment

- QSM provides real-time stress, strain, and torsion data from 240 sensor arrays surrounding the jacking and shoring points
- **Automatic Safety Halts:** The integrated jacking control system will automatically pause or halt the lifting/lowering operation if QSM data exceeds pre-set yellow or red line thresholds
- **Override Prohibition:** Never override a QSM-initiated safety halt without a full structural engineering review and authorization

**QSM Monitoring Thresholds:**
```yaml
QSM_Safety_Thresholds:
  Green_Zone: "0-50% of design limit stress"
  Yellow_Zone: "50-80% of design limit stress"
  Red_Zone: "80-95% of design limit stress"
  Emergency_Stop: ">95% of design limit stress"
  
  Actions:
    Green: "Normal operation permitted"
    Yellow: "Reduced speed operation, increased monitoring"
    Red: "Immediate pause, engineering review required"
    Emergency: "Automatic stop, emergency procedures activated"
```

### 2.4 Personnel and Equipment Certification

**Required Personnel Certifications:**
- AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 Lifting Operations Specialist (Level III)
- Quantum Systems Integration Technician (QSM certified)
- Ground Support Equipment Operator (Heavy Lift certified)

## 6. General Lifting and Lowering Philosophy

### 6.1 Synchronized, QSM-Monitored Operation

The core principle is **"lift as one."** The Central Jack Controller ensures all jacks raise and lower the aircraft at a precisely synchronized rate, typically no faster than 2 cm (0.8 in) per minute.

The QSM operator continuously monitors the structural data feed. The operation is governed by a "green-yellow-red" light system on the QIT display, representing structural stress levels.

### 6.2 QSM Lifting Protocol

The following protocol must be initiated in the QSM system before lifting commences:

```yaml
QSM_Lifting_Protocol:
  Operation_Mode: "MAINTENANCE_LIFT"
  Aircraft_Config: "AS-M-PAX-BW-Q1H"
  Fuel_Load_kg: 2500 # Example value, must match actual
  Cargo_Load_kg: 0
  
  Safety_Thresholds:
    Yellow_Limit: "0.5% deviation from predicted strain model"
    Red_Limit: "0.8% deviation from predicted strain model"
    
  System_Action:
    On_Yellow_Limit: "PAUSE_LIFT and ALERT_OPERATOR"
    On_Red_Limit: "HALT_LIFT and LOCK_HYDRAULICS"
    
  Status: "AWAITING_ACTIVATION"
```

### 6.3 Lowering Procedure

Lowering follows the same principles as lifting but in reverse. The QSM monitors for any binding or uneven load distribution as the aircraft settles onto its landing gear or shoring points. The rate of descent must also be precisely controlled.

## 7. General Shoring Philosophy

### 7.1 Purpose of Shoring

Shoring is used to provide long-term, stable support to the airframe when:
- One or more landing gear assemblies are removed for maintenance
- Major structural repairs are being performed, requiring a fixed, stable airframe
- The aircraft is being prepared for long-term storage
- Emergency structural support is required

### 7.2 Procedure Overview

**Standard Shoring Sequence:**
1. Lift the aircraft to the required height using the standard jacking procedure
2. Position the structural shores under the designated shoring hard points (e.g., SHP-L1/R1)
3. Carefully raise the shores until they make contact with the interface pads
4. Initiate a "Load Transfer" function in the QSM system
5. Slowly and carefully lower the jacks to transfer a portion of the aircraft's weight to the shores
6. The QSM system will confirm when the load is distributed correctly between the remaining jacks and the shores
