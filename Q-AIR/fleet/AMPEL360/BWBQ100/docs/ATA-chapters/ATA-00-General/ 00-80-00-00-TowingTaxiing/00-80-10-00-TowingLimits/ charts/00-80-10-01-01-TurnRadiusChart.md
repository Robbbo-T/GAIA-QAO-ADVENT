- **Structural Analysis:** EASA CS-25 certified design data
- **Flight Test Results:** Ground handling test program
- **Operational Experience:** Real-world performance validation
- **Simulation Models:** Validated mathematical models
- **Quantum Monitoring:** QSM system performance data

### 1.3 Chart Accuracy and Limitations

**Data Accuracy:**
- Turn radius calculations: ±0.1 meter
- Clearance envelopes: ±0.2 meter safety margin included
- Speed relationships: ±0.5 knot measurement accuracy
- Environmental factors: ±5% adjustment accuracy

**Application Limitations:**
- Charts valid for standard airport pavement surfaces
- Environmental adjustments required for extreme conditions

## 10. Chart Usage Instructions

### 10.1 Chart Reading Guidelines

**Step 1: Identify Required Information**
- Determine aircraft weight and configuration
- Identify desired turn radius or steering angle
- Assess environmental conditions
- Verify equipment availability

**Step 2: Apply Environmental Corrections**
- Use Chart 4.1 for wind corrections
- Apply Chart 4.2 for surface conditions
- Consider Chart 4.3 for temperature effects
- Combine factors multiplicatively

**Step 3: Verify Equipment Capabilities**
- Check Chart 6.1 for tug specifications
- Review Chart 6.2 for tow bar limitations
- Use Chart 6.3 for equipment selection
- Confirm load capacity margins

**Step 4: Calculate Final Parameters**
- Start with Chart 2.1 for basic turn radius
- Apply weight corrections from Chart 7.1
- Include CG effects from Chart 7.2
- Add environmental factors from Section 4

### 10.2 Chart Interpolation Methods

**Linear Interpolation Between Data Points:**
```
For values between chart points:
Interpolated Value = Y₁ + (X - X₁) × (Y₂ - Y₁) / (X₂ - X₁)

Where:
X = Desired input value
X₁, X₂ = Chart values bracketing X
Y₁, Y₂ = Chart outputs for X₁, X₂
```

**Example: Aircraft weight 75,000 kg**
```
Chart 7.1 shows:
70,000 kg → Factor 1.05
80,000 kg → Factor 1.15

Interpolation:
Factor = 1.05 + (75,000 - 70,000) × (1.15 - 1.05) / (80,000 - 70,000)
Factor = 1.05 + 5,000 × 0.10 / 10,000
Factor = 1.05 + 0.05 = 1.10
```

### 10.3 Chart Accuracy Verification

**Cross-Reference Verification:**
- Use multiple charts to verify calculations
- Compare calculated values with operational experience
- Verify environmental corrections with real-time data
- Confirm equipment performance with manufacturer specifications

**Quality Assurance Checks:**
- All values within reasonable operational ranges
- Environmental factors applied correctly
- Equipment limitations respected

## Appendix B: Calculation Examples

### B.1 Turn Radius Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Aircraft weight 75,000 kg, 45° steering, 15-knot crosswind, wet surface

**Step 1: Base Turn Radius**
```
Steering Angle: 45°
Base Turn Radius: 15.6m (from Chart 2.1)
```

**Step 2: Apply Weight Correction**
```
Aircraft Weight: 75,000 kg
Weight Factor: 1.10 (interpolated from Chart 7.1)
Weight-Adjusted Radius: 15.6m × 1.10 = 17.2m
```

**Step 3: Apply Environmental Corrections**
```
Crosswind Factor: 1.08 (15 knots from Chart 4.1)
Surface Factor: 1.15 (wet surface from Chart 4.2)
Environmental-Adjusted Radius: 17.2m × 1.08 × 1.15 = 21.4m
```

**Step 4: Calculate Clearance Requirements**
```
Outer Wingtip Radius: √[(21.4 + 26.4)² + (18.5)²] = 51.8m
Required Clear Zone: 51.8m + 3.0m safety = 54.8m
```

**Final Result:**
- **Effective Turn Radius:** 21.4m
- **Required Clear Zone:** 54.8m radius
- **Maximum Speed:** 5 knots (due to environmental conditions)

### B.2 Equipment Selection Example

**Scenario:** Aircraft weight 85,000 kg, required turn radius 12m, standard weather

**Step 1: Weight Assessment**
```
Aircraft Weight: 85,000 kg
Weight Category: Heavy Weight (HW)
Enhanced procedures required
```

**Step 2: Turn Radius Assessment**
```
Required Turn Radius: 12m
Steering Angle Required: ~55° (from Chart 2.1)
Operation Category: Precision positioning
```

**Step 3: Equipment Requirements**
```
Weight Requirement: >150,000 kg capacity needed
Turn Requirement: <6.2m capability needed
Conclusion: Precision Tug (GQAO-TUG-ART-200) required
```

**Step 4: Verification**
```
Precision Tug Capacity: 200,000 kg ✓
Precision Tug Min Radius: 6.2m ✓
Weight Margin: (200,000 - 85,000) / 200,000 = 57.5% ✓
```

**Equipment Selection:** Precision Tug with Flexible Tow Bar
