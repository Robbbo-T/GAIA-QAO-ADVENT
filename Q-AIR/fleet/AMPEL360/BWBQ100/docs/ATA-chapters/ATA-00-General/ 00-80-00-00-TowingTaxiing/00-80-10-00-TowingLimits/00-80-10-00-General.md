## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document establishes the comprehensive towing limitations for the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft. These limitations are derived from structural analysis, certification requirements, operational experience, and the unique characteristics of the Blended Wing Body configuration with integrated quantum systems.

### 1.2 Limitation Categories

Towing limitations are classified into several categories based on their origin and criticality:

**Category 1 - Structural Limitations:**
- Derived from structural design limits and certification basis
- Absolute limits that must never be exceeded
- Based on ultimate load factors with appropriate safety margins
- Applicable to all towing operations regardless of conditions

**Category 2 - Operational Limitations:**
- Based on operational safety and handling characteristics
- May vary with environmental conditions and aircraft configuration
- Subject to pilot/crew discretion within specified parameters
- Include speed, weather, and procedural limitations

**Category 3 - Equipment Limitations:**
- Determined by ground support equipment capabilities
- Include tug capacity, tow bar ratings, and attachment point limits
- May vary by equipment type and configuration
- Subject to equipment certification and inspection status

**Category 4 - Environmental Limitations:**
- Based on weather conditions, surface characteristics, and external factors
- Variable limits depending on current conditions
- Include wind, visibility, temperature, and surface contamination limits
- Require real-time assessment and monitoring

### 1.3 Regulatory Basis

All towing limitations comply with:
- **EASA CS-25.485:** Side load on ground
- **FAA Part 25.485:** Side load factors for landing gear
- **ICAO Annex 14:** Aerodrome design and operations
- **IATA AHM 910:** Aircraft towing and pushback
- **GAIA-QAO Standard GQAO-TOW-001:** BWB towing requirements

### 1.4 Safety Philosophy

The towing limitation framework follows the GAIA-QAO principle of "No Operation Without Assurance":

- **Multiple Barriers:** Layered protection through design, procedures, and monitoring
- **Conservative Approach:** Safety margins incorporated at all levels
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous assessment of conditions and parameters
- **Adaptive Limits:** Ability to adjust limits based on real-time conditions
- **Human Oversight:** Qualified personnel supervision at all times

### Appendix B: Calculation Methods

#### B.1 Load Distribution Calculations

**Center of Gravity Impact on Gear Loading:**
```
Nose Gear Load = (Aircraft Weight × (CG - Main Gear Position)) / Wheelbase
Main Gear Load = Aircraft Weight - Nose Gear Load

Where:
CG = Center of gravity position (% MAC converted to distance)
Main Gear Position = 24.1m aft of nose
Wheelbase = 15.6m between nose and main gear
```

**Lateral Load Distribution:**
```
Left Main Gear = (Total Main Load / 2) + (Lateral CG Offset × Weight / Track)
Right Main Gear = (Total Main Load / 2) - (Lateral CG Offset × Weight / Track)

Where:
Track = 15.6m between main gear centerlines
Lateral CG Offset = Distance from centerline (positive = right)
```

#### B.2 Turn Radius Calculations

**Geometric Turn Radius:**
```
Turn Radius = Wheelbase / tan(Steering Angle)

Where:
Wheelbase = 15.6m (nose to main gear distance)
Steering Angle = Nose wheel deflection angle

Wingtip Path Radius:
Inner Wingtip = Turn Radius - (Wing Span / 2)
Outer Wingtip = Turn Radius + (Wing Span / 2)
```
