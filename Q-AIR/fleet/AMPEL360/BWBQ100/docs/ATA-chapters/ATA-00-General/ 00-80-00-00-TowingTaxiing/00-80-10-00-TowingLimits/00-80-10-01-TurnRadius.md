## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document provides comprehensive turn radius specifications for the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft during towing operations. The unique Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration presents distinctive challenges for ground maneuvering due to its large wingspan, unconventional geometry, and distributed mass characteristics.

### 1.2 Turn Radius Definition

For the purpose of this document, turn radius is defined as the distance from the center of the turning circle to the aircraft's center of rotation during a ground maneuver. Multiple reference points are considered due to the BWB's unique geometry:

**Primary Reference Points:**
- **Nose Gear Center:** Primary control point for towing operations
- **Aircraft Center of Gravity:** Mass center for dynamic analysis
- **Geometric Center:** Midpoint of wing span and length
- **Wingtip Positions:** Critical clearance determination points

### 1.3 Regulatory Framework

Turn radius specifications comply with:
- **ICAO Annex 14, Volume I:** Aerodrome design requirements
- **IATA Airport Development Reference Manual:** Ground movement standards
- **EASA AMC 25.485:** Ground handling and taxi operations
- **FAA AC 150/5300-13A:** Airport design standards
- **GAIA-QAO Standard GQAO-TURN-001:** BWB turning performance requirements

### 1.4 BWB Unique Characteristics

The BWB configuration affects turn radius through:
- **Large Wingspan:** 52.8m creates extensive clearance requirements
- **Non-Conventional Shape:** Blended surfaces complicate clearance calculations
- **Distributed Mass:** Non-traditional center of gravity affects dynamics
- **Variable Ground Clearance:** Wingtip height varies across span
- **Multiple Critical Points:** Several areas require simultaneous monitoring

### 2.2 Geometric Turn Radius Calculations

#### 2.2.1 Basic Turn Radius Formula

**Nose Wheel Steering Turn Radius:**
```
R = L / tan(δ)

Where:
R = Turn radius to nose gear center (meters)
L = Wheelbase (15.6 m)
δ = Nose wheel steering angle (degrees)

Example Calculations:
δ = 30°: R = 15.6 / tan(30°) = 27.0 m
δ = 45°: R = 15.6 / tan(45°) = 15.6 m
δ = 60°: R = 15.6 / tan(60°) = 9.0 m
δ = 75°: R = 15.6 / tan(75°) = 4.2 m
```

#### 2.2.2 Wingtip Path Calculations

**Wingtip Turning Radius:**
```
For Left Turn (δ positive):
R_wingtip_inner = √[(R - 26.4)² + (18.5)²]
R_wingtip_outer = √[(R + 26.4)² + (18.5)²]

For Right Turn (δ negative):
R_wingtip_inner = √[(R + 26.4)² + (18.5)²]
R_wingtip_outer = √[(R - 26.4)² + (18.5)²]

Where:
R = Nose gear turn radius
26.4 m = Half wingspan
18.5 m = Wingtip X-coordinate offset
```

**Critical Wingtip Path Examples:**
```
Nose Gear Turn Radius: 30.0 m
Inner Wingtip Radius: 18.7 m
Outer Wingtip Radius: 57.2 m
Total Swept Width: 114.4 m

Nose Gear Turn Radius: 15.6 m (45° steering)
Inner Wingtip Radius: 21.4 m
Outer Wingtip Radius: 43.1 m
Total Swept Width: 86.2 m
```

### 2.3 Clearance Envelope Analysis

Nose/Tail                  2.0 m minimum
Landing Gear               1.5 m minimum
Antennas/Probes           1.0 m minimum
```

**Total Clearance Envelope:**

Minimum Turn (75° steering) 48.1 m
Normal Turn (45° steering)  89.2 m
Wide Turn (30° steering)    117.4 m
```

## 4. BWB-Specific Considerations

### 4.1 Unique Geometric Challenges

#### 4.1.1 Non-Conventional Reference Points

Unlike conventional aircraft with distinct fuselage and wing components, the BWB requires specialized reference points for turn calculations:

**Traditional Aircraft Reference:**
- Fuselage centerline (simple linear reference)
- Wing attachment points (discrete locations)
- Landing gear positions (fixed relationship)

**BWB Reference Complexity:**
- Blended centerline (varies along aircraft length)
- Distributed wing structure (no discrete attachment)
- Variable cross-sections throughout aircraft
- Multiple critical clearance points simultaneously

#### 4.1.2 Center of Gravity Variations

**CG Range Impact on Turn Characteristics:**
```
Forward CG (15% MAC):
- Increased nose gear loading (+15%)
- Enhanced steering authority
- Reduced turn radius capability
- Improved directional stability

Aft CG (35% MAC):
- Reduced nose gear loading (-20%)
- Decreased steering authority
- Increased minimum turn radius
- Requires enhanced monitoring

Lateral CG Offset:
±1.0%: Minimal impact on turn performance
±1.5%: Asymmetric turn characteristics
±2.0%: Enhanced procedures required
```

#### 4.1.3 Structural Flexibility Effects

**Wing Deflection Impact:**
```
Fuel Loading Conditions:
Empty Wings: Minimal deflection, standard clearances
Partial Fuel: Moderate deflection, monitor clearances
Full Fuel: Maximum deflection (+2.1m at tip)
- Reduced ground clearance
- Modified clearance calculations
- Enhanced monitoring required
```

**Dynamic Loading During Turns:**
```
Turn-Induced Loads:
Lateral Acceleration: 0.05g maximum during turns
Structural Response: Wing deflection varies with loading
Clearance Impact: Real-time monitoring required
```

### 4.2 Distributed Mass Characteristics

#### 4.2.1 Moment of Inertia Effects

**BWB vs. Conventional Aircraft:**
```
Yaw Moment of Inertia:
BWB Configuration: ~40% higher than conventional
Impact on Turn Dynamics: Slower response to steering inputs
Required Compensation: Earlier steering input initiation
Enhanced Monitoring: Dynamic response assessment
```

**Mass Distribution Sensitivity:**
```
Fuel Distribution Effects:
Center Tank: Minimal impact on yaw inertia
Wing Tanks: Significant impact on turn dynamics
Asymmetric Fuel: Enhanced turn monitoring required

Passenger/Cargo Distribution:
Forward Loading: Reduced turn responsiveness
Aft Loading: Enhanced turn responsiveness
Lateral Loading: Asymmetric turn characteristics
```

#### 4.2.2 Dynamic Stability Considerations

**Turn Initiation Characteristics:**
```
Steering Input Response:
Initial Response Time: 2-3 seconds (vs. 1-2 for conventional)
Steady-State Achievement: 8-10 seconds
Overshoot Tendency: Minimal due to high inertia
Damping Characteristics: Well-damped response
```

**Turn Completion Dynamics:**
