## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This document establishes comprehensive weight limitations for towing operations of the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft. These limitations are derived from structural certification, equipment capabilities, ground handling characteristics, and the unique load distribution properties of the Blended Wing Body configuration.

### 1.2 Weight Limitation Categories

Weight limitations are classified into several categories based on their safety criticality and operational impact:

**Category A - Structural Limits:**
- Based on aircraft structural design and certification
- Absolute limits that must never be exceeded
- Derived from ultimate load factors with safety margins
- Independent of environmental conditions

**Category B - Equipment Limits:**
- Based on ground support equipment capabilities
- Include tug capacity, tow bar ratings, and surface loading
- May vary by equipment type and configuration
- Subject to equipment certification status

**Category C - Operational Limits:**
- Based on handling characteristics and operational safety
- Include center of gravity and load distribution limits
- May vary with environmental conditions
- Subject to crew training and experience levels

**Category D - Regulatory Limits:**
- Based on certification and regulatory requirements
- Include maximum certified weights and configurations
- Subject to regulatory oversight and compliance
- May require special approvals for deviations

### 1.3 BWB Weight Distribution Characteristics

The BWB configuration presents unique weight distribution challenges:

- Non-linear structural response
- Advanced composite structure behavior

**Ground Handling Impact:**
