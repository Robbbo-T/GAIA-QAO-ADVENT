### Appendix B: Quantum Gravimeter Operation Manual (GAIA-GSE-QG-02-OM)

#### B.1 Principles of Operation
The GAIA-GSE-QG-02 is a transportable absolute quantum gravimeter based on cold atom interferometry. It measures the absolute value of the local gravitational acceleration (`g`) by precisely tracking the free-fall trajectory of a cloud of laser-cooled Rubidium-87 atoms in a vacuum. By comparing the measurements from four synchronized units, a true geodetic horizontal plane can be computed with unprecedented accuracy, independent of any structural or floor-level variations.

#### B.2 Setup and Stabilization Procedure
1.  **Placement:** Position the four gravimeter units on the hangar floor at the pre-surveyed, marked locations (forming a large square around the aircraft).
2.  **Power On:** Connect to clean, UPS-backed power. Allow a **minimum of 2 hours** for thermal stabilization and vacuum system pump-down. The status indicator on each unit must turn from red to green.
3.  **Vibration Isolation:** Activate the active seismic isolation system on each unit. The control panel should indicate a vibration level below the `VG-A` threshold.
4.  **Network Integration:** Connect each unit to the QIT console via the dedicated quantum fiber link. Verify that all four units appear on the QIT's `Leveling System Dashboard`.
5.  **Initiate Gravity Plane Definition:** From the QIT, run the `Gravimetric Plane Definition` sequence. This takes approximately 15 minutes and involves each unit taking 50 absolute `g` measurements, which are then processed to define the horizontal reference plane.
    - **Successful Output:** The QIT will display `GRAVIMETRIC PLANE DEFINED AND STABLE` with a confidence factor.
    - **Failure (Alert `ERR-QG-02`):** Indicates excessive ground vibration or thermal instability. Cease all hangar activity and allow the system to re-stabilize.

### Appendix C: Laser Interferometry System Setup Guide (GAIA-GSE-LIS-03-SG)

#### C.1 System Components
- **Laser Head (3x):** Frequency-stabilized He-Ne laser source.
- **Tripod/Mount (3x):** High-stability mounts for the laser heads, placed on fixed floor monuments.
- **Retroreflectors (SMRs) (12x):** Spherical Mounted Retroreflectors to be placed on the aircraft's LRM points.
- **Weather Station (1x):** Measures temperature, pressure, and humidity for atmospheric compensation.

#### C.2 Setup Procedure
1.  **Mount Laser Heads:** Securely mount the three laser heads on their designated floor monuments.
2.  **Power On & Stabilize:** Allow a **minimum of 1 hour** for the laser sources to warm up and achieve frequency lock. The status light on each head will turn from amber to green.
3.  **Place SMRs:** Using appropriate access platforms, carefully clean and place the SMRs on the aircraft LRM targets (LRM-F, LRM-A, LRM-C, LRM-L, LRM-R, and others as required).
4.  **Initial Alignment:** Manually aim each laser head at its primary SMR target.
5.  **Initiate Auto-Acquisition:** From the QIT, run the `LIS Target Acquisition` sequence. The system will automatically fine-tune its aiming to lock onto the center of each SMR.
6.  **Verify Lock:** The QIT dashboard will show `LIS_LOCK_ACQUIRED` for all active laser paths. The signal strength for each path must be >90%.
    - **Failure (Alert `ERR-LIS-01`):** Indicates a problem with beam alignment, a dirty optic, or an obstruction. The path must be cleared and the acquisition sequence re-run.

### Appendix D: QSM Deflection Compensation Algorithm Theory

#### D.1 The Problem of Structural Sag
The AMPEL360 BWB, with its 60-meter wingspan, is not a rigid body. Under its own weight, the structure flexes. The wingtips may deflect downwards by several centimeters relative to the center when supported on jacks. Simply leveling the LRM points does not guarantee the entire aircraft is in a neutral, un-stressed state.

#### D.2 The QSM Solution
The Deflection Compensation Algorithm uses the QSM system's 240+ strain and stress sensors to build a real-time, 3D model of the aircraft's structural state.
1.  **Baseline Model:** The system starts with the `Digital Lift Twin (DLT)` model, which represents the ideal, perfectly neutral, "zero-g" shape of the aircraft.
2.  **Live Strain Measurement:** The QSM network continuously measures the actual strain (stretching or compressing) in every key structural member.
3.  **Real-Time FEM:** This live strain data is fed into a real-time Finite Element Model (FEM) running on the QIT's processing cluster.
4.  **Deflection Calculation:** The FEM calculates the physical displacement (deflection) at any point on the aircraft's surface that corresponds to the measured strain state. For example, it can calculate that a measured strain of 'X' in the main spar corresponds to a 'Y' mm droop at the wingtip.
5.  **Correction Application:** When the laser interferometer measures the position of LRM-L on the port wing, the algorithm instantly subtracts the calculated deflection value from the measurement. This provides the "true" position of the LRM as if the structure were perfectly rigid.

**Simplified Formula:**
`Corrected_LRM_Position = Measured_LIS_Position - Calculated_QSM_Deflection`

This quantum-assisted shaping process ensures the aircraft is not just geometrically level, but also structurally neutral, which is the true goal of the procedure.
