**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-20

## CRITICAL BWB WEIGHT & BALANCE NOTICE

**WARNING:** The Blended Wing Body configuration presents unique ground stability challenges:
- Wide CG travel range (18% - 35% MAC)
- Non-linear weight distribution
- Asymmetric loading sensitivity
- Reduced tip-back margin compared to conventional aircraft

**All ground operations must maintain CG within the GREEN ZONE envelope**

---

- **Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC):** 8.5m
- **MAC Leading Edge:** Station 420 (17.5m aft of datum)

- Cockpit and avionics: 2,100 kg
- Nose landing gear: 850 kg
- Forward cargo bay: 1,200 kg

| 15,000-20,000 kg | +0.5% MAC | Outer wing |
| >20,000 kg | +1.2% MAC | Trim tank |

---

## 3. LOADING SEQUENCE REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Standard Loading Sequence
**MANDATORY SEQUENCE to maintain CG within limits:**

1. **Fuel Loading** (if required)
   - Center tank first (maintains forward CG)
   - Wing tanks symmetrically
   - Trim tank last (only if >15,000 kg total)

2. **Aft Cargo**
   - Load aft cargo before forward
   - Maximum 4,000 kg until forward cargo added
   - Monitor nose wheel load (>3,500 kg)

3. **Forward Cargo**
   - Balance against aft cargo
   - Use load planning software LPS-BWB

4. **Catering/Supplies**
   - Galleys loaded symmetrically
   - Quantum system supplies last

5. **Passengers**
   - Zone 3 (center) first
   - Zones 2&4 (mid) simultaneously  
   - Zones 1&5 (forward/aft) last

### 3.2 Unloading Sequence
**REVERSE of loading with exceptions:**
- Deplane center sections last
- Maintain 10% fuel minimum until cargo offloaded
- Monitor CG continuously via QSM system

---

## 4. GROUND STABILITY CALCULATIONS

### 4.1 Tip-Back Prevention

**Tip-Back Margin Formula:**
```
TBM = (CG_max - CG_actual) × Weight / (MLG_arm × 100)
Where:
- TBM = Tip-back margin (kg)
- CG_max = 35.5% MAC (tip-back point)
- MLG_arm = Main gear moment arm (4.25m)
```

**Minimum Margins Required:**
- Normal operations: 5,000 kg
- Windy conditions (>25 kts): 7,500 kg
- Cargo loading: 8,000 kg

### 4.2 Lateral Stability (BWB-Specific)

Due to wide wing span and low CG height:
```
Lateral Stability Index (LSI) = Track_width × Weight / (CG_height × Span)
Minimum LSI = 1.5 (Normal ops)
Minimum LSI = 2.0 (Wind >20 kts)
```
