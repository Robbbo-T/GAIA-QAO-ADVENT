### Appendix G: Measurement Uncertainty Analysis

#### G.1 Uncertainty Budget Template

**Quantum-Enhanced Precision Leveling System (QEPLS):**

| Uncertainty Source | Type | Value | Distribution | Divisor | Standard Uncertainty |
|-------------------|------|--------|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| Quantum measurement | A | 0.0005° | Normal | 1 | 0.0005° |
| Environmental drift | B | 0.0003° | Rectangular | √3 | 0.0002° |
| Calibration reference | B | 0.0002° | Normal | 2 | 0.0001° |
| Resolution | B | 0.0001° | Rectangular | √3 | 0.00006° |
| Vibration effects | B | 0.0002° | Rectangular | √3 | 0.0001° |
| Temperature effects | B | 0.0001° | Rectangular | √3 | 0.00006° |

**Combined Standard Uncertainty:**
```
u_c = √(0.0005² + 0.0002² + 0.0001² + 0.00006² + 0.0001² + 0.00006²)
u_c = √(0.00000031) = 0.00056°
```

**Expanded Uncertainty (k=2, 95% confidence):**
```
U = k × u_c = 2 × 0.00056° = 0.001°
```

#### G.2 Uncertainty Calculation Procedures

**Step-by-Step Uncertainty Analysis:**

1. **Identify Uncertainty Sources:**
   ```
   Step 1: List all known sources of measurement uncertainty
   Step 2: Classify each source as Type A (statistical) or Type B (systematic)
   Step 3: Determine probability distribution for each source
   Step 4: Estimate magnitude of each uncertainty component
   ```

2. **Calculate Standard Uncertainties:**
   ```
   Type A (Statistical):
   u_A = s/√n
   where s = sample standard deviation, n = number of measurements
   
   Type B (Systematic):
   u_B = a/k
   where a = half-width of distribution, k = coverage factor
   ```

3. **Combine Uncertainties:**
   ```
   Combined Standard Uncertainty:
   u_c = √(Σu_i²)
   
   Expanded Uncertainty:
   U = k × u_c
   where k = coverage factor (typically 2 for 95% confidence)
   ```
