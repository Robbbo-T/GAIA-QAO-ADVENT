| Standby | 1 | Entry qualified | Ready |

### 5. SAFETY EQUIPMENT

#### 5.1 Personal Protective Equipment
- [ ] Supplied air respirator system
- [ ] Tyvek suits (fuel resistant)
- [ ] Non-sparking tools only
- [ ] Intrinsically safe lighting
- [ ] Communication headsets

#### 5.2 Monitoring Equipment
- [ ] Multi-gas detector (O2, LEL, VOC)
- [ ] Personal monitors for entry crew
- [ ] Ventilation system (explosion-proof)
- [ ] Emergency extraction equipment

### 6. TANK PREPARATION

#### 6.1 Defuel and Purge (Prior shift)
1. Defuel tank completely
2. Purge with nitrogen (5 volumes)
3. Ventilate with air (10 volumes)
4. Test atmosphere:
   - Oxygen: 20.5-21.5%
   - LEL: <10%
   - Fuel vapor: <50 ppm

#### 6.2 Access Preparation
1. Remove tank access panels
2. Install ventilation ducting
3. Set up safety equipment
4. Establish communication
5. Brief all personnel

### 7. INSPECTION PROCEDURE

#### 7.1 Entry Sequence (30 minutes)

1. **Final Atmosphere Test**
   ```
   Test at multiple levels:
   a. Tank opening: O2_____ LEL_____
   b. Mid-level: O2_____ LEL_____
   c. Tank bottom: O2_____ LEL_____
   d. All readings within limits
   e. Begin continuous monitoring
   ```

2. **Personnel Entry**
   ```
   Entry protocol:
   a. Entry permit signed
   b. Communication check
   c. Equipment check
   d. Enter tank slowly
   e. Continuous atmosphere monitoring
   f. Report every 5 minutes
   ```

#### 7.2 Structural Inspection (4 hours)

3. **Systematic Coverage**
   ```
   Divide tank into zones:
   a. Lower skin and stringers
   b. Spar webs and caps
   c. Rib structures
   d. Upper skin internals
   e. Baffle areas
   
   For each zone inspect:
   - Fastener integrity
   - Sealant condition
   - Corrosion signs
   - Crack indications
   - Impact damage
   ```

4. **Critical Areas Focus**
   - Spar/rib intersections
   - Fuel pump mounting
   - Access door frames
   - Previous repair areas
   - High-stress locations

#### 7.3 Sealant Inspection (2 hours)

5. **Sealant Condition Assessment**
   ```
   Check all sealed areas:
   a. Faying surface seals
   b. Fillet seals
   c. Fastener wet installs
   d. Access door seals
   
   Look for:
   - Disbonding
   - Cracking/checking
   - Discoloration
   - Fuel weepage evidence
   ```

#### 7.4 Quantum Sensor Verification (1.5 hours)

6. **Fuel Level Sensor Inspection**
   ```
   For each quantum probe:
   a. Check mounting security
   b. Verify wire integrity
   c. Clean probe surface
   d. Test insulation resistance
   e. Record probe number/condition
   ```

7. **Quantum Leak Detection Grid**
   - Verify sensor positions
   - Check optical clarity
   - Test fiber connections
   - Clean as required
   - Document any damage

### 8. FINDINGS DOCUMENTATION

#### 8.1 Defect Mapping
- Use tank diagram sheets
- Mark exact locations
- Photograph all findings
- Measure defect sizes
- Classify severity

#### 8.2 Immediate Actions
| Finding Type | Action Required |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Crack >0.5" | Stop inspection, Engineering required |
| Fuel weepage | Mark for sealant repair |
| Corrosion Level 2+ | Schedule treatment |
| Loose fastener | Temporary secure, permanent fix later |

### 9. TANK EXIT PROCEDURE

#### 9.1 Exit Protocol
1. Final inspection sweep
