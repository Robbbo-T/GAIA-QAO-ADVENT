## 2. Diagnostic Philosophy

### 2.1. Predictive-First, Zero-Surprise Doctrine
Our methodology prioritizes fault anticipation through a multi-layer data fusion model, designed to surface precursors to failure long before they become mission-affecting events.

#### 2.1.1. Quantum Telemetry Mesh (QTM)
A distributed network of quantum sensors provides continuous monitoring of system health with unprecedented sensitivity:

- **Dynamic Threshold Adaptation Loop:** Sensor sensitivity auto-tunes for normal aging drifts, reducing false positives over the airframe's lifecycle
- **Quantum Coherence Monitoring:** Real-time assessment of quantum system health using decoherence rate metrics
- **Environmental Compensation:** Automatic adjustment for altitude, temperature, and electromagnetic environment variations
- **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning algorithms identify patterns indicating potential future failures

#### 2.1.2. Classical Sensors & BITE Integration
Provide event-driven fault codes and contextual validation, offering crucial redundancy for abrupt system failures:

- **Real-time Correlation:** QTM data cross-referenced with traditional BITE outputs
- **Anomaly Pattern Recognition:** Historical fault data used to improve diagnostic accuracy
- **Environmental Context:** Flight phase, weather conditions, and operational parameters integrated into fault analysis

#### 2.1.3. AI Diagnostic Core (Q-CORE)
A federated suite of version-controlled, domain-specific AI models operating within defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs):

- **Domain-Specific Models:** Specialized AI modules for different aircraft systems (propulsion, flight controls, avionics, etc.)
- **Confidence Scoring:** All AI recommendations include confidence levels and uncertainty bounds
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Transparent decision-making process with human-interpretable reasoning
- **Continuous Learning:** Federated learning approach maintains fleet intelligence while preserving operator privacy

### 2.2. Tiered Diagnostic & Remediation Authority
Troubleshooting authority is tiered to balance autonomy with human-in-the-loop governance, ensuring safety while maximizing operational efficiency.

| Tier | Level | Description | Intervention Protocol | Example Actions |
| :--: | ----- | ----------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | **Autonomous** | Q-CORE resolves routine, low-criticality events via software reconfiguration | Pre-approved by flight crew; logged in DIKE registry | Sensor recalibration, software parameter adjustment |
| 2 | **AI-Assisted** | Q-CORE provides diagnosis and recommended action; execution requires certified technician approval | Standard maintenance workflow with dual verification | Component replacement, system checks, configuration changes |
| 3 | **Human-Governed** | For high-criticality or novel anomalies, Q-CORE acts as decision-support tool for collaborative engineering team | Mandatory dual-signature override and detailed analysis | Major system failures, unknown fault patterns, safety-critical systems |

4. **AI Triage:** Q-CORE analyzes data package against defined ODD, generating ranked list of potential root causes
5. **Quantum Signal Correlation:** Leading hypothesis validated against known quantum fault signatures
6. **Historical Pattern Matching:** Fleet-wide data analyzed for similar events and successful resolution methods
7. **Confidence Assessment:** System publishes confidence scores and uncertainty bounds for all diagnoses

#### 3.1.3. Human Interface & Decision Making
8. **Crew/MCC Notification:** Alerts tiered by criticality and aligned with EASA Human Factors standards
9. **Maintenance Planning:** System auto-populates blockchain-based work order with:
   - Recommended maintenance actions
   - Required tools and parts
   - Estimated completion time
   - Safety considerations
10. **Quality Assurance:** All actions logged in immutable DIKE registry for traceability

### 3.2. Emergency Response Procedures
For critical system failures requiring immediate attention:

- **Automatic Escalation:** Tier 3 events automatically escalate to senior maintenance staff and engineering support
- **Remote Support:** Real-time video link with factory experts for complex diagnoses
