## 1.0 Introduction and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides comprehensive length specifications for the AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 aircraft, defining all longitudinal dimensions critical to the aircraft's design, manufacturing, certification, and operational requirements. These specifications establish the definitive longitudinal geometric framework for the world's first quantum-enhanced blended wing body aircraft.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers:
- **Overall Aircraft Length:** Extreme length measurements and configurations
- **Fuselage Length:** Center body longitudinal dimensions
- **Wing Chord Distributions:** Leading and trailing edge definitions
- **Critical Length Stations:** Key longitudinal reference points
- **Manufacturing Length Tolerances:** Precision requirements for quantum integration
- **Operational Length Considerations:** Ground handling and airport compatibility

### 1.3 Length Measurement Philosophy
The BWB-Q100 length specifications are based on three fundamental principles:
1. **Quantum Precision:** Sub-millimeter accuracy using quantum interferometry
2. **Holistic Integration:** Length optimization considers aerodynamic, structural, and quantum system requirements
3. **Adaptive Design:** Future-ready for morphing technology and configuration changes
