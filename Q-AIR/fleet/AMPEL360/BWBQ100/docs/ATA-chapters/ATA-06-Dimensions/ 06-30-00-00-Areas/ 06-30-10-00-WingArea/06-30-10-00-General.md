## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 BWB Wing Area Philosophy

The AMPEL360 BWB-Q100 represents a paradigm shift in aircraft design where the traditional distinction between wing and fuselage is eliminated. The **858.3 m² (9,236 ft²) wing area** is seamlessly integrated with the passenger cabin, creating a unified lifting body that maximizes both aerodynamic efficiency and passenger comfort.

| **Wing Area Parameter** | **Specification** | **BWB Advantage** |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Total Wing Area | 858.3 m² (9,236 ft²) | 35% more efficient than conventional |
| Wing Loading | 629 kg/m² (128.8 lb/ft²) | Optimal for BWB configuration |
| Aspect Ratio | 9.1 | Enhanced efficiency with structural integration |
| Sweep Angle | 35° at leading edge | Optimized for cruise performance |
| Cabin Integration | 48.768 m length | Unprecedented passenger area within wing |

### 1.2 Unique BWB Wing Characteristics
