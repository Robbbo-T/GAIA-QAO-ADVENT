## 5. Cross-Sectional Height Distribution

### 5.1 Height Contour Analysis

#### 5.1.1 Mathematical Height Profile
The BWB cabin height follows an optimized elliptical profile:

```
Height Function: h(x) = h_max × √(1 - (x/w_max)²)

Where:
h_max = 2.743 m (maximum height at centerline)
w_max = 9.144 m (half-width to minimum height boundary)
x = distance from centerline (Buttline position)

Height Calculations:
At BL ±0.000: h = 2.743 m × √(1 - 0) = 2.743 m
At BL ±3.048: h = 2.743 m × √(1 - (3.048/9.144)²) = 2.692 m
At BL ±6.096: h = 2.743 m × √(1 - (6.096/9.144)²) = 2.438 m
At BL ±9.144: h = 2.743 m × √(1 - (9.144/9.144)²) = 2.032 m
```

#### 5.1.2 Height Gradient Analysis
- **Maximum Gradient:** 0.711 m height change over 9.144 m width
- **Gradient Rate:** 0.078 m per meter lateral (7.8% slope)
- **Passenger Perception:** Gradual change imperceptible during movement
- **Structural Efficiency:** Optimal load distribution through curved profile

### 5.2 Height Zone Utilization

#### 5.2.1 Functional Height Mapping

└─ Capacity: 100% of passengers can stand comfortably

Limited Standing Zone (2.134 - 2.438 m height):
├─ Width: BL ±6.096 to ±7.620 (3.048 m each side)

├─ Function: Seated passenger operations only
└─ Capacity: Seated comfort, emergency access only
```

#### 5.2.2 Cross-Sectional Area Analysis
```
