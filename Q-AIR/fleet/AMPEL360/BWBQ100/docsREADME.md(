## üö¶ Usage Guidelines

### For System Engineers
1. Start with relevant ATA chapters for system overview
2. Reference ICDs for integration requirements
3. Use specifications for detailed technical data

### For Maintenance Personnel
1. Primary reference: AMM for procedures
2. Component work: CMM for shop repairs
3. Structural issues: SRM for damage limits and repairs

### For Certification Teams
1. Performance data in `specifications/performance/`
2. Compliance matrices in service bulletins
3. System safety analyses in ATA chapter appendices

### For Quantum Systems
1. Begin with `ATA-XX-80-QuantumSystems/` overview
2. Reference quantum specifications for operational limits
3. Follow special handling procedures in relevant manuals
