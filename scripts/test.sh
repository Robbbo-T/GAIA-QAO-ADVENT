# GAIA-QAO-AdVent Unified Test Runner Script
# Version: 2.0.0
# Author: GAIA-QAO Verification & Validation Team
#
# Description:
# This script is the main entry point for running various test suites across the
# GAIA-QAO project. It allows for selective execution of unit tests,
# integration tests, and end-to-end (e2e) system tests.
#
# Usage: ./test.sh [suite]
# Suites:
#   unit (default) : Runs fast unit tests for all services. Ideal for pre-commit checks.
#   integration    : Runs tests that verify interactions between services (requires Docker).
#   e2e            : Runs end-to-end scenarios simulating a full mission profile.
#   quantum        : Runs specific tests for quantum algorithms and simulators.
#   all            : Runs all test suites sequentially.
