# Security Policy

## GAIA-QAO-AdVent Aerospace Platform

Security is paramount for the GAIA-QAO-AdVent platform, especially given its application in mission-critical aerospace and quantum-compute environments. This policy outlines how we handle vulnerabilities, security assessments, and responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not create a public GitHub issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email the Security Team:**  
   Send a detailed description to [security@gaia-qao.org](mailto:security@gaia-qao.org).  
   Please include:
   - Affected component or module (e.g., `/quantum/`, `/wasm/`, `/telemetry/`)
   - Version(s) affected
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact assessment (e.g., remote code execution, data leakage, denial of service)
   - Any relevant logs, PoC, or crash dumps

2. **PGP Encryption (Recommended):**  
   Our public PGP key is available at [https://gaia-qao.org/pgp-key.asc](https://gaia-qao.org/pgp-key.asc) for secure communication.

3. **Response Time:**  
   We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days and provide a timeline for remediation if confirmed.

## Security Best Practices

- **Keep dependencies up-to-date.**  
  Use the latest supported versions of all dependencies across Node.js, Python, and native modules.

- **Enforce Principle of Least Privilege.**  
  Run all services with the minimum required permissions (see `/docker-compose.yml` and `/kubernetes/`).

- **Code Signing & Verification.**  
  All production builds and WASM binaries must be signed. Validate signatures before deployment.

- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography.**  
  Prefer quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber, Falcon) for all communications and at-rest encryption.

- **Air-Gapped and Hardened QPUs.**  
  Quantum backends and hardware bridges should be isolated and monitored for side-channel risks.

- **Continuous Monitoring.**  
  Integrate with SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK, etc.) for anomaly and intrusion detection.

- **Comply with DO-326A and DO-356A.**  
  All airborne components must follow industry security standards for safety and cyber-resilience.

## Vulnerability Management

- Vulnerabilities are tracked privately until a fix is released.
- Public advisories are issued via the project’s GitHub [Security Advisories](https://github.com/gaia-qao/GAIA-QAO-AdVent/security/advisories) and [gaia-qao.org/security-advisories](https://gaia-qao.org/security-advisories).
- All security patches are documented and traceable for certification.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We value and recognize the contributions of security researchers. If you responsibly disclose a vulnerability, you may be eligible for acknowledgment in release notes and the project website.
